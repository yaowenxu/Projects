==============
 INTRODUCTION 
==============

          I  thought  I would write this FAQ as I don't think there  is  one
          currently  around,  and I think there should be for  such  a  cool
          game!   Double Dragon is a (new [1995]) Neo Geo Beat 'em up  game,
          available  in the arcades and on the home systems.   I myself  own
          the  Neo  Geo  CD version,  therefore all moves  shown  have  been
          discovered/confirmed by me.



==============
 GAME DETAILS 
==============

          There are so many things that players can do in this game with the
          characters,  as well as the over-the-top special moves!   The game
          features  screen zooming to many levels (like  Samurai  Showdown),
          but if both characters keep moving further apart,  they can become
          VERY  far apart.   Also,  (when far apart) characters can  have  2
          Fireballs on the screen at once (do the first, then immediately do
          the second one).   Backgrounds are also 'interactive',  in the way
          that  characters  can be thrown/hit into objects or parts  of  the
          backgrounds.    A  good  example  is  when  playing  against  Duke
          (sub-boss).   Hitting him can sometimes send him into the  picture
          of Shuko (boss), knocking it off the wall!

          Usual beat 'em up round winning rules apply.   All moves shown are
          for characters facing to the right.


BUTTONS:-

               A - weak attack
               B - medium attack
               C - strong attack
               D - super strong attack

          There  are  no  defined  kicks or punches in  this  game  for  the
          buttons,  the  characters punch or kick when a button  is  pressed
          depending upon the situation they are in.


BASIC MOVEMENT:-

              UB    U    UF   
                O   O   O     
                 \  |  /      
            B  O--     --O  F 
                 /  |  \      
                O   O   O     
              DB    D    DF   








          Holds & Throws -

               Holds or Throws can be done with  O--  or  --O  + B,  C or  D
               button.  More details are shown in each characters section.

               Characters  can  also  Air Throw,  using  the  above  method. 
               Again, more details are shown in each characters section.

               NOTE  -   Cheng Fu and Eddie CANNOT Air Throw.   Nor can  the
                         bosses, Duke and Shuko.

                                                      O       O       O
          Double Jump    - Jump, whilst in the air;    \  or  |  or  /


          In the Air     - Air Defense;      O--  whilst being attacked


          On the Ground  - Back Dash;        O-- O--

                           Forward Dash;     --O --O

                           Downed Offensive;  |  + any button
                                              O
                                                   Do this after you have
                                                   knocked down your
                                                   opponent.  Your character
                                                   will jump leaving a trail
                                                   of shadows and attack the
                                                   downed opponent.



COLOUR SELECTION:-

          4  colours  can be selected,  using either of the A,  B,  C  or  D
          buttons  when selecting a character.   The A button is the  normal
          colour.  B, C or D buttons are the alternative colours.  The START
          button can also be used, which has the same result as pressing the
          A button.

          The CPU colour can also be selected in this way when selecting the
          CPU opponent manually (home version).



MUSIC:-

          As  usual,  each stage has its own music (some are pretty  good!). 
          However,  if  using Billy or Jimmy Lee,  when they  perform  their
          'Dragon Transformation'  move,  the music will change to their own
          special music for the remainder of that round,  whichever stage is
          currently being played on or whichever character fighting against.









HOME VERSION DETAILS:-


NOTE  -   This section only applies to the Home versions of the game
          (cartridge and CD formats).


Intro Sequence;

          There  seems  to  be  a different intro on  the  CD  Home  system. 
          Usually,  the  arcade version shows the different  characters  and
          their Special/Charge moves.   The CD version only shows Billy  and
          Jimmy Lee fighting, showing their Special/Charge moves.


Character Size;

          The  game can be paused by pressing the SELECT button at any  time
          during a round.  Whilst the game is paused, pressing A, B,  C or D
          can  change  your  characters  size!   In  2  player  game,   both
          characters can do this.  If playing the CPU,  pressing the buttons
          on the unused pad will alter the CPU's character size.

          Sizes are;     Button    Size

                           A  -    Large - default
                           B  -    Quite small
                           C  -    Small
                           D  -    VERY small (tiny)

          Pressing the SELECT button will un-pause the game and let you play
          the game with your characters at the chosen size.

          When 'shrunk'  all moves are also shrunk!   The only things  which
          are remain normal size are projectiles.  Also,  when Very Small or
          Small  (C or D button used),  the characters hit reach is as  they
          would  be  for their normal size, so even if the  characters  look
          apart (not touching), throws, specials etc.  still connect.   This
          all takes some getting used to, but is GREAT FUN!


Alternate Character Selection Screen Faces;

          I   did   this  by accident once.  I was  playing  around  in  the
          options screen,  changing settings.  I then started a game and the
          Character  Selection Screen's characters faces had all changed  to
          the  SNK  baby/cartoon versions.   I have never managed to  do  it
          again, but will try to find out how it is done.














==================
 CHARGE INDICATOR 
==================

          Each  character's  Energy Bar is overlaid with another  bar  which
          fills  up BLUE,  and is the Charge Level of your character.   This
          goes  up  everytime  you execute a move which  connects  with  the
          opponent (blocked or not).  Throws also increase the Charge level. 
          When the Blue bar meets your current Energy level, the word CHARGE
          replaces your character' name, and it will flash.   At this point,
          extra  moves  are  available for your  character  (see  individual
          character details).   Once used,  the Charge level will return  to
          zero.

          The  lower  your character's energy is, the quicker it is  to  get
          your Charge Indicator flashing (when you attack the opponent).

          To  use  the  Charge  Moves,  the  moves  available  are   usually 
          performed the same as the normal special moves but using 2 buttons
          instead  of  one  button (see each character's  Charge  Moves  for
          details).  On the Home Neo Geo CD system, I find using the B and D
          buttons together work well.



===================
 CHARACTER DETAILS 
===================

All moves shown are for characters facing to the right.

When  (close) is specified next to a move,  the move must be  executed  when
next/close to an opponent.

'Charge' moves can only be executed when the character's CHARGE indicator is
flashing.

The statistics for each player are:-    POW - Power level
                                        SPD - Speed level
                                        DEF - Defensive level

                                        All out of 5;  1 is lowest
                                                       5 is highest

Specific character details now follow.
